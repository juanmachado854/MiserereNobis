Over this next week or so I plan to add a portfolio section with some of my architectural work; In preperation for the career fair that occurs on 10/9?/2025. Besides that, I don't know what else I'll add these next couple days as this is this 90's esque internet blog idea is still anew in my mind. No matter what arises, I plan on filling this site with stuff, whether it be jargon, or my relfections on text that I find enjoyable. Any way, I am regurgitating what has already been stated, so I guess this is all for now."
