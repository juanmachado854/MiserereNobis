    "text": "Hi. This will be my corner of the internet where I will share whatever I am currently enjoying/learning/hating. That is my gift, not liking stuff. Over this next week or so I plan to add a portfolio section with some of my architectural work. To be better prepared for the career fair that occurs on 10/9?/2025. Besides that, I don't know what else I'll add to this site the next couple of days. No matter what arises, I plan on filling this site with stuff, whether it be jargon, or my relfections on text that I find enjoyable. Any way, I am regurgitating what has already been stated, so I guess this is all for now."

    "text": "So far I have been enjoying living in Minneapolis. Everything is nearby. The thing that I am currently working on is improving my ability to sit down and read. I need to design a space in my apartment that makes sitting down and reading attractive again. The issue is the lighting... I have a single window that is north-facing, on top of that, I am on the 1st floor surrounded by big buildings. So note to self: Fix this issue, the sweetness of the fruit outweighs the bitterness of lugging a desk up a flight of stairs. Also, I will upload some catholic/christian apologetic arguments to this site soon. I'll start with the Thomistic contingency argument."
