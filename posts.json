    "text": "Hi. This will be my corner of the internet where I will share whatever I am currently enjoying/learning/hating. That is my gift, not liking stuff. Over this next week or so I plan to add a portfolio section with some of my architectural work to be better prepared for the career fair that occurs on 10/9?/2025. Besides that, I don't know what else I'll add to this site the next couple of days. No matter what arises, I plan on filling this site with stuff, whether it be jargon, or my relfections on text that I find enjoyable. Any way, I am regurgitating what has already been stated, so I guess this is all for now."

    "text": "So far I have been enjoying living in Minneapolis. Everything is nearby. The thing that I am currently working on is improving my ability to sit down and read. I need to design a space in my apartment that makes sitting down and reading attractive again. The issue is the lighting... I have a single window that is north-facing, on top of that, I am on the 1st floor surrounded by big buildings. So note to self: Fix this issue, the sweetness of the fruit outweighs the bitterness of lugging a desk up a flight of stairs. Also, I will upload some catholic/christian apologetic arguments to this site soon. I'll start with the Thomistic contingency argument."

    "text": "Today I woke up sick. I write this blog at 11:20 am and have already drank 3 cups of coffee. I still feel sick and tired. I have all day to work on homework though, no school, no work, no duties today due to my sickness... productivity, productivity, & more productivity. Just kidding, so far I have only watched a podcast that added zero substance to my life. The most I have done today is rebuild this site so it looks cleaner and more cohesive. Besides that, nothing of importance or of growth. As for personal things to do, I have started uploading some of my architectural work, and would like to add a few more projects. I thought of this conceptual urbanism idea: What if we tried to create a neighborhod block for a community of stylites? (See Simeon The Stylite for examples) I think this would be fun for me to model as well as try to think of how people living on large columns would utiilize space. It would force me to think of things like: How large is the distance between each person? How accessisble should water and food be to the community until it becomes detrimental to their spiritual pursuits? Will their be a person delivering water and food or do could the residents have direct access to the resources? etc. I am not sure if I will pursue this idea yet, but the idea arose in me when I read about St. Anthony of the desert, reading about this saintly human reminded me of St. Simeon. Just a thought... but if anyone gets inspired by this post, please do it. I am sure that you will make it better and more cohesive than I ever could. My will is what the Lord wills, & what the Lord will is what is best for us. I put this idea out as a challenge to myself, as a challenge to you the reader, and as a challenge of the Overton Window of what is expected for the way humans use space. The spirit of America will be made anew in the coming years, our job is to start working toward it."
